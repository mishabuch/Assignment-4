Markov Decision Processes - abuch6 Amisha Buch

Before running the project, you will need to install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file.
- You would require Python 3.7, Pandas and sklearn
- An IDE which supports running Jython
- You can use Eclipse, with PyDev installed from the market place.
- Plotting code is in Python 3.7, Pandas and matplotlib

Running the algorithms
- The project has 2 main files - forest.py and grid_world.py. Run each of these files independently
to run both of these experiments.
- Running these files will create output txt files for the data and plots for the various planning and RL algorithms.

Other files
- forest_plots.py has all the code for plotting graphs for the forest management experiment
- grid.py has the grid class to create a grid with obtacles.
- mdp.py which has the mdptoolbox algorithms for ValueIteration, PolicyIteration and QLearning

All the code for this project can be found at:
